   abstract = {Nature-based solutions are increasingly used in domestic wastewater treatment, because of their potential to remove contaminants and pathogens from water (e.g., stormwater, river water, wastewater) as well as their provided co-benefits, such as mitigation of the heat island effect or enhanced biodiversity. The transition from traditional grey technologies towards nature-based solutions in domestic wastewater treatment might yield multiple benefits for local communities while enhancing biodiversity. Although some nature-based solutions such as treatment wetlands have been used for decades in domestic wastewater treatment, this is not the case for others such as green walls or roofs, which lack implementation guidelines and design criteria. Aiming to support implementation of nature-based solutions in domestic wastewater treatment, we have developed an online decision-support system for the pre-selection of the best nature-based solution to use in each socio-environmental context and adapted to the needs, as well as an estimate of the required area. Our decision-support system's recommendations are based on an expert knowledge-driven approach, building on two complementary expert knowledge elicitation workshops. We hope the developed online decision-support system will support the transition towards integrating nature-based solutions into urban water and wastewater treatment systems.},

	abstract = {Horizontal ﬂow wetlands have been designed using the so-called P-k-C* approach, which has been largely embraced by the treatment wetlands literature. P is meant to represent the equivalent number of apparent tanks in series (hydraulic factor), but also incorporates the loss of biodegradability as the wastewater undergoes treatment (kinetic factor). For design purposes, literature proposes ﬁxed values of P. The proposal of this paper is to decouple hydraulics from kinetics and use the traditional concept of N or NTIS (number of tanks in series) as a function of geometric relationships of the wetland to be designed, leaving kinetic elements to be dealt with solely by the ﬁrst-order removal rate coefﬁcient (k). From the literature, a database with 41 wetlands with data from tracer studies was used, and a novel regressionbased equation was derived relating N with the ratio length/depth of horizontal wetlands. This equation can be used at the design stage for estimating N and, hence, the output concentration of the pollutant using the traditional structure of the TIS model, with a possible inclusion of background concentration (C*). The paper presents all relevant equations, including those from the plug-ﬂow with dispersion model (PFD), and it is shown how to convert from one hydraulic model to the other, what is also believed to be a novel approach in the treatment wetland literature. Finally, the area-based removal rate coefﬁcients (kA) proposed by Kadlec and Wallace (2009) for designs of horizontal wetlands treating domestic wastewater based on the P-k-C* approach are converted into kA values for the TIS model in the paper.},
