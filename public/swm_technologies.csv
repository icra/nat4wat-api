PP_GR,Pervious pavements,Grass reinforcement,"A type of ground protection that uses plastic or concrete grids infilled with grass or gravel to create a load-bearing, natural grass reinforced surface. Grass reinforcement is most suitable for lightly trafficked locations, especially where it only has seasonal use, so that the grass has time to recover.
