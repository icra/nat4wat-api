# Multicriteria decision analysis

Multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) is a method to weight different criteria to get a final score for each technology. Each criteria is weighted between 0 and 5 regarding the importance that the criteria has in the use case.

## Criteria

### Environmental impact

It is calculated as a combination of energy use, eutrophication risks and biohazard risks:

$$
EI = \frac{(1 - e) + r_{NH_4} + r_{NO_2} + (1 - \frac{br}{3})}{4}
$$

Where $EI$ is environmental impact ($\in[0,1]$) being 1 the lowest impact; $e$ is energy use ($\in{0,1}$); $r_{NH_4}$ is the capacity of the technology to remove ammonia ($\in\{0,1\}$); $r_{NO_2}$ is the capacity of the technology to remove nitrates ($\in\{0,1\}$); and $br$ is the biohazard risk of the technology ($\in[0,3]$).

### Multifunctionality

Multifunctionality considers the capacity of the tehcnology to provide cobenefits and ecosystem services. It is calculated as an average of all cobenefits:

$$
M = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i = 1}^N{\frac{cb_i}{3}}
$$

Where $M$ stands for multifunctionality ($\in[0,1]$) being 1 the highest multifunctionality; $N$ is the number of considered cobenefits; and $cb_i$ is the score for the cobenefit $i$ ($\in[0,3]$). 

### Space requirements

Space requirements is the surface needed for the technology. In case, the scenario has enough information to estimate the surface, the estimated mean surface is used. Otherwise, the ratio $m2/pe$ for each technology is used instead. The surfaces of compared technologies are normalized as follows:

$$
SR_i = \frac{s_{min}}{s_i}
$$
where $SR_i$ is the space requirements ($\in(0,1]$) for technology $i$; $s_{min}$ is the minimum surface among all compared technologies and $s_i$ is the surface of technology $i$.

### Operation and manteinance

Operation and manteinance is the level of difficulty in keep the technology properly working. It is estimated as a combination of required manpower and required skills:

$$
OM = 1 - \frac{m + s}{6}
$$
Where $OM$ is the operation and manteinance score ($\in[0,1]$) being 1 the lowest operation and manteinance requirements; $m$ is the level of required manpower ($\in[0,3]$); and $s$ is the level of required skills ($\in[0,3]$).

## Weights

Each criteria is weighted by the user according to the priorities of the specific case. Each criteria can be weighted using a 5-point Likert scale from "Not important at all" to "Very important". Then this information is used to weight the score of each criteria.

Then this weights are converted to proportions ($\Sigma{w} = 1$). Therefore, weighted all criteria as very important get the same results that weighted all of them as not important:

$$
p_{wc} = \frac{w_c}{\Sigma{w}}
$$
where $p_{wc}$ is the proportion ($\in[0,1]$) of the weight for criteria $c$; $w_c$ is the weight ($\in[0,5]$) for criteria $c$ and $\Sigma{w}$ is the sum of the weights of all criteria.
