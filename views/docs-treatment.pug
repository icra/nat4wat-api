            li inhabitants (positive number): The number of people served by the technology.
            li litresPerson (positive number): The litres of wastewater generated by a person in a day. Default: <code>120</code>.
            li inflow (positive number): The inflow in litres/day. If not provided is calculated as <code>inhabitants * litresPerson</code>
            li climate (string): The climate of the scenario, according to Koppen classification. Default: <code>temperate</code>.
                ul One of the following:
                    each climate in climates

                            code=climate
            li avgTemperature (number): The average temperature of the coolest month in the scenario.
                | If <code>climate</code> is not provided, this is used to classify the climate.
            li area (positive number): The available surface to allocate the technology.
            li vertical (boolean): If <code>false</code>, green wall technologies are rejected.
            li verticalArea (positive number): The available vertical surface to allocate vertical technologies.
            li household (boolean): If <code>true</code>, only technologies that are available at house scale are selected.
            li ecosystemServices (key:value object): The technologies are filtered in terms of the provision of ecosystem services. The values admitted are from 0 (none) to 3 (high). All technologies providing the ecosystem services at that level or higher are included in the list of technologies returned.
                ul The ecosystem services admitted are:

            li energy (string 'yes'|'no'): If 'no' technologies not using energy are selected. If 'yes' only technologies using energy are selected.
            li manPower (int 0:3): Manpower is the level of work hours required for the operation of the technologies. When provided, all technologies with a higher level of manpower are rejected.
            li skills (int 0:3): Skills refer to the required technical knowledge to operate the technology. When provided, all technologies with a higher level of manpower are rejected.
            li biohazardRisk (int 0:3): Biohazard risks include microorganisms, viruses and toxins that can affect human health. When provided, all technologies with a higher level of manpower are rejected.
            li techID (string): This is a backdoor to get a specific technology. It returns an array of length 1.
        ul <b>Responses</b>
